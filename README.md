# Weather API
A Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I utilized a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

I used the following scatter plots to visualize the data:
 - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
 - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
 - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
 - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

# Vacation API
I used the data i gathered above, as well as jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API to plan likely vacation spots for the future.
